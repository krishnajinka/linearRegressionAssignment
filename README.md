## General Information
- This assignment is a programming assignment wherein we have to build a multiple linear regression model for the prediction of demand for shared bikes. This project contains a Jupyter notebook for the same. 
- Build a model to understand the factors on which the demand for these shared bikes depends
- Build a model with smaller set of independent variables which can be analyzed to predict the shared bikes demand 
- Bike Sharing dataset

## Conclusions
- Thus, for the model with 6 variables, the r-squared on training and test data is about 71.3% and 69.09% respectively. The adjusted r-squared on the train set is about is about 71.0%.
- From heat map shown in python file, and previous all steps of train and test, reducing the R squared values are proof that, this is the simplest model we can build. The data shows the low correlations as final predictors Hence, with 6 variables (from earlier 28), we can consider this as final model. Therefore we can go ahead with this model and make use of it for predicting the daily bike rentals count.
